# Employee-Management-Information-systems
This is my Very First Project in Windows Form Application. 
For Database, I have used "Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition".

In this, first their is a Login Screen where Admin/Employee will enter his Login Information and Sign In to his account.

In the Admin Section, the admin can perform the following operations:
* View, Update or Delete The Information of All the Employees
* Add New Employee Data
* Add New Work Department

In the Employee Section, the exployee can perform the following actions:
* Submit Daily Work report with In-time & Out-Time
* Apply For Leave with a table displaying the total leaves applied as well as total remaining leaves for the year .
